****************CAUTION AND RECOMMENDATION****************
You might not get the certificate and also your coursera 
account might get terminated if found to be copying othe-
r's work and strictly prohibited to copy this work as you 
might get into trouble for plagarism.

I suggest you to us this as a reference so as to know the
algorithm to solve the problem if you feel confused with 
question or have spent many hours for one problem and st-
ill not getting any way out to solution, then just have a
look at it and try to develop your own different algorithm
and do the code yourself. Good Luck
